# Publish a Plugin

## Requirements to Submit a Plugin

If you plan on submitting your plugin to the [pytest-dev organization] you need
to meet the following requirements:

-   PyPI presence with a setup.py that contains a license, pytest-
    prefixed, version number, authors, short and long description.
-   a tox.ini for running tests using Tox.
-   a README describing how to use the plugin and on which platforms
    it runs.
-   a LICENSE file or equivalent containing the licensing information,
    with matching info in setup.py.
-   an issue tracker unless you rather want to use the core Pytest
    issue tracker.

Please see the official guidelines at [Submit a Plugin].
